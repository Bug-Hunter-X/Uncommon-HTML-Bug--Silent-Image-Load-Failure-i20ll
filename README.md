# Uncommon HTML Bug: Silent Image Load Failure
This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to images. The code attempts to load an image from a non-existent source. While the browser doesn't throw an error, the image fails to load, resulting in a broken image icon.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version that includes error handling for image load failures.

This bug is relatively uncommon because most developers handle image loading explicitly; however, it can be encountered in situations where there are implicit image sources or reliance on dynamic content generation.
